#+TITLE: NixOS Configuration

* Introduction

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration files. They are managed using Git and symlinked to /etc/nixos on my machine.

** Directory Structure

- `configuration.nix`: This is the main configuration file.
- `hardware-configuration.nix`: This file is generated by `nixos-generate-config` and contains hardware-specific settings. It's recommended not to edit this file directly. I've omitted this file for obvious reasons. 

* Usage

To use these configuration files, clone this repository to your local machine and create a symbolic link from /etc/nixos to the cloned repository.

Remember, any changes to these configuration files must be followed by running `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes.

* Laptop Configuration: ThinkPad P16s (Ryzen Pro 7)

This NixOS configuration provides an example of how you can configure the ThinkPad P16s laptop with Sway, a popular tiling window manager for Wayland. The configuration is tailored to take advantage of the laptop's hardware and optimize the user experience. Here are some key points:

** Sway Window Manager
 
Sway is a highly customizable tiling window manager for Wayland, offering a lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional X Window Managers. It provides a sleek, keyboard-driven workflow and excellent multi-monitor support. With Sway, you can enjoy a seamless and productive desktop environment.

** Hardware Configuration

*** Processor

The ThinkPad P16s is equipped with an AMD Ryzen Pro 7 processor, which offers exceptional performance for demanding tasks. This configuration takes advantage of the Ryzen processor by enabling the necessary kernel modules and optimizing the system for optimal CPU utilization.

*** Graphics

The laptop features integrated AMD Radeon graphics, providing
excellent display capabilities. The configuration includes the necessary packages and drivers to enable hardware-accelerated graphics and take full advantage of the GPU capabilities.

*** Wireless Connectivity

The laptop uses a Qualcomm QCNFA765 Wireless Network
Adapter. The configuration enables the necessary networking components to ensure seamless wireless connectivity. Make sure to install the required firmware and drivers for your specific wireless adapter.

** Customization and Personalization

*** Dotfiles

The configuration includes various dotfiles and settings that can be customized to suit your preferences. You can modify the Sway configuration, theme, keybindings, and other settings to personalize your desktop environment. I have an example: [[https://github.com/mbrignall/sway-dotfiles][sway-dotfiles]]

*** Emacs Configuration

This setup also includes a pre-configured Emacs environment with Doom Emacs. Emacs is a powerful text editor that can be customized and extended to suit your specific needs. The Doom Emacs configuration provides a curated set of packages and settings for a smooth and efficient editing experience.

You can also take a look at my Doom config [[https://github.com/mbrignall/doom-emacs][here]].
