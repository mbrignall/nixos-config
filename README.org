#+TITLE: NixOS Configuration

* Introduction

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration files. They are symlinked to the ~nixos-config~ folder in my home directory.

** Directory Structure

- ~configuration.nix~: This is the main configuration file.
- ~hardware-configuration.nix~: This file is generated by ~nixos-generate-config~ and contains hardware-specific settings. It's recommended not to edit this file directly. I've omitted my file for obvious reasons.

* Usage

To use these configuration files, clone this repository to your local machine and place the ~configuration.nix~ file in ~/etc/nixos/~. Alternatively you can create a symbolic link from ~/etc/nixos~ to the repository directory.

Remember, any changes to these configuration files must be followed by running `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes.

* Laptop Configuration

This NixOS configuration provides an example of how you can configure the ThinkPad P16s laptop with Sway, a popular tiling window manager for Wayland. The configuration is tailored to take advantage of the laptop's hardware and optimize the user experience.

** Sway Window Manager

Sway is a highly customizable tiling window manager for Wayland, offering a lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional X Window Managers. It provides a sleek, keyboard-driven workflow and excellent multi-monitor support.

** Customization and Personalization

*** Dotfiles

The configuration includes various dotfiles and settings that can be customized to suit your preferences. You can modify the Sway configuration, theme, keybindings, and other settings to personalize your desktop environment. I have an example: [[https://github.com/mbrignall/sway-dotfiles][sway-dotfiles]]

*** Doom Emacs Configuration

This setup also includes a pre-configured Emacs environment with Doom Emacs.

You can also take a look at my Doom config [[https://github.com/mbrignall/doom-emacs][here]].

* Warning

Please be aware that these configuration files are tailored to my specific hardware and personal preferences. You are welcome to use them as a reference, but blindly copying them may not work and could even harm your system. Always review and understand configuration files before using them.

* Learning

This repo is a work in progress. It was to help develop my understanding of the Nix ecosystem and daily drive the OS. I have learned a lot and love to share my progress to hopefully help you too!

*** Future steps

- Learn Home Manager
- Build a Flake
- Further customise and refine configuration

* Contributing

While this is a personal project, I'm always open to suggestions and improvements. Feel free to open an issue or pull request.
