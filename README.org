#+TITLE: NixOS Configuration

* Introduction

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration files. They are managed using Git and symlinked to /etc/nixos on my machine.

** Directory Structure

- `configuration.nix`: This is the main configuration file.
- `hardware-configuration.nix`: This file is generated by `nixos-generate-config` and contains hardware-specific settings. It's recommended not to edit this file directly.

* Usage

To use these configuration files, clone this repository to your local machine and create a symbolic link from /etc/nixos to the cloned repository.

Remember, any changes to these configuration files must be followed by running `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes.

* Warning

Please be aware that these configuration files are tailored to my specific hardware and personal preferences. You are welcome to use them as a reference, but blindly copying them may not work and could even harm your system. Always review and understand configuration files before using them.

* Contributing

While this is a personal project, I'm always open to suggestions and improvements. Feel free to open an issue or pull request.
